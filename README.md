# image-segmentation
Video segmentation in MATLAB using Mean Shift Algorithm for segmenting images. 
Bandwith needs to be chosen by the user.
I found bandwith of 0.16-0.20 works best without losing much detail.

Contains 2 additional MATLAB scripts.
First will extract frames from a video.
Second assembles segmented videos back together.
